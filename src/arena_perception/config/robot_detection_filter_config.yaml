# Enhanced Transform Filter Configuration
# ========================================

# Filter Configuration
# -------------------
filter:
  # Filter type (choose one):
  # - no_filter:       No filtering (for debugging)
  # - moving_average:  Simple moving average
  # - ewma:            Exponential weighted moving average (recommended)
  # - kalman:          Kalman filter with constant velocity model
  # - complementary:   Complementary filter (best for real-time)
  # - median:          Median filter for outlier removal
  # - butterworth:     Butterworth low-pass filter
  type: "median"
  
  # General parameters
  window_size: 10        # Number of samples for moving average/median
  publish_rate: 30.0     # Publishing rate in Hz (when transform is available)
  
  # EWMA parameters (alpha = smoothing factor, 0-1)
  # Higher alpha = more responsive, lower alpha = smoother
  alpha: 0.3
  
  # Complementary filter parameters
  # Higher complementary_alpha = trust measurements more
  complementary_alpha: 0.7
  
  # Butterworth filter parameters
  cutoff_freq: 5.0      # Cutoff frequency in Hz (should be < publish_rate/2)
  order: 2              # Filter order (higher = steeper rolloff)
  
  # Kalman filter parameters
  process_noise: 0.01   # Q matrix scaling
  measurement_noise: 0.1 # R matrix scaling
  
  # Median filter parameters
  median_window: 3      # Reduced from 10 for lower latency (3-5 is good for real-time)

# Frame Configuration
# ------------------
frames:
  # Parent frame (where the input transforms originate from)
  # This should match the frame_id from your detection node
  parent_frame: "arena_camera_optical"
  

# Performance Tuning
# ------------------
performance:
  tf_cache_time: 1.0     # TF buffer cache time in seconds
  diagnostics_rate: 5.0  # How often to print diagnostics (seconds)
